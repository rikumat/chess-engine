# Week 4

## Weekly progress
This week i completed creating my own move generator. According to extensive unittests, it should work properly. Consequently, custom move generation is now ready, waiting for integration with the Ai. I decided to leave this to next week as it would pose a stability risk if done during the final hours before the deadline.

## Unclear and troubling things
Everything is quite clear right now.

## Next steps
The next step of the project is to integrate custom move generator with the Ai and remove python-chess module from the project. After this is done, the next step will be to order legal moves to better support my evaluation function to gain performance. THis includes prioritizing forward moving moves, since my evaluation function gives better value to moves that move towards the opponent's king.

### Hours used: 10
