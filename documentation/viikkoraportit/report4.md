# Week 4

## Weekly progress
This week i completed creating my own move generator. According to extensive unittests, it should work properly. Consequently, custom move generation is now ready, apart from the integration with the Ai. I decided to leave this to next week as it would pose a stability risk if done during the final hours before the deadline.

## Unclear and troubling things
Everything is quite clear right now.

## Next steps
The next step of the project is to integrate custom move generator with the Ai and remove python-chess module from the project. After this is done, the next step will be to order the moves to better support my evaluation function to gain performance.

### Hours used: 3
